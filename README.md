# vim config

My vim config, in this README I would like to keep things about the config.

## Open relative

`<leader>e` autocompletes to open a file in CWD, while `<leader>E` opens the
current dir. Might change that...

## Format paragraphs

`gqq` to only format current line. What I don't like about this is that takes
into account the size of the terminal, so I need to open the terminal fully
first before formatting the paragraph.
